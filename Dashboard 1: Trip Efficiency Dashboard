## 🎯 Objective:
The **Trip Efficiency Dashboard** is designed to monitor and analyze delivery trip efficiency across various regions. This tool empowers Delhivery to identify patterns in trip durations, delivery delays, and the factors affecting delivery performance. The ultimate goal is to provide actionable insights for optimizing trip scheduling and enhancing delivery performance.

## 📊 Key Performance Indicators (KPIs):

### ⏱️ **Average Trip Duration**:
- **Definition**: The average time taken to complete a delivery trip, calculated from the trip start time to the trip end time.
- **Formula**: Average(Trip End Time - Trip Start Time)
- **Objective**: Monitor overall delivery efficiency and track improvements over time.

### 🕒 **On-Time Delivery Rate (%)**:
- **Definition**: The percentage of trips completed within the estimated time.
- **Formula**: (Number of On-Time Deliveries / Total Deliveries) × 100
- **Objective**: Measure adherence to delivery schedules and identify delays.

### 🚩 **Late Deliveries Count**:
- **Definition**: The total number of trips exceeding the estimated delivery time.
- **Objective**: Highlight operational inefficiencies and pinpoint improvement areas.

### 📏 **Average Distance per Trip**:
- **Definition**: The average distance covered by a delivery vehicle during a trip.
- **Formula**: Average(Distance Covered)
- **Objective**: Assess logistics efficiency in route planning.

### 📅 **Trips Completed per Day**:
- **Definition**: The total number of trips completed daily.
- **Objective**: Monitor trip volume and plan capacity effectively.

### ⛽ **Average Fuel Usage per Trip** *(Optional)*:
- **Definition**: The average fuel consumed per delivery trip.
- **Objective**: Track environmental and cost impacts of deliveries.

- **Impact**: Track the performance of completed vs. ongoing trips.

### 🛣️ **Trip Distance Slicer**:
- **Purpose**: Filter trips by distance traveled (e.g., short, medium, long trips).
- **Impact**: Understand efficiency for varying trip lengths.

### 📅 **Day of the Week Slicer**:
- **Purpose**: Analyze trends by weekdays vs. weekends.
- **Impact**: Inform scheduling decisions based on daily patterns.

### 🌅 **Time of Day Slicer** *(Optional)*:
- **Purpose**: Filter data by time slots (e.g., morning, afternoon, evening).
- **Impact**: Optimize scheduling based on time-of-day performance.
